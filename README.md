# _Solver_

#### _Javascript tool for solving & simplifying algebra equations & expressions, 2/24/17_

#### By _**Molly LeCompte**_

## Description

_Incomplete- not all change types accounted for at this point. The following are equations that pass testing:
*_6 + 60 = x^2 -2_
* _2x + 3x + 4x = 90_
* _2x + 2x * 4 = 16_
* _1x * 2x * 3x = 12_
* _4x -2x - 2 = 20_
* _(4x + 2) * (3x + 3)_

_Tests that shall not pass (yet):_
*_(4x - 2) * (3x - 3) * (x+2) = 60 --> see second substep of first step_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone this repository_
* _Using the command line, change into the top level of the project directory_
* _Enter the command, "npm install" to install npm & dependencies_
* _Enter the command "npm build" to build the browserify bundle_
* _Enter the command, "npm run watch" to use watchify your local changes_

## Technologies Used

_Javascript, jQuery, Node, mathsteps library (https://github.com/socraticorg/mathsteps), browserify, watchify, Mathquill, lodash _
