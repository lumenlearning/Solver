# Roadmap

A rough roadmap for `mathsteps`

Last time we did a ground truth to see what concepts are needed to answer
questions asked in the Soratic app, this was the breakdown (note that some
concepts might overlap and both need to be covered for us to solve the problem):

- Factoring: 22.84% of questions
- Solve Equation: 17.99% of questions
- Systems of equations: 6.34% of questions
- Negative exponents: 1.96% of questions

## Version 1.x

- Factoring quadratics to solve equations ([open issues that are
  related](https://github.com/socraticorg/mathsteps/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen%20equation))
- Factoring (quadratics and other simple factoring) to simplify polynomial
  fractions
- Improving exponents ([open issues that are
  related](https://github.com/socraticorg/mathsteps/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+exponents+label%3Aexponents))
- Improving roots ([open issues that are
  related](https://github.com/socraticorg/mathsteps/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Aroots%20))
- Systems of equations ([#48](https://github.com/socraticorg/mathsteps/issues/48))

## Version 2.x
